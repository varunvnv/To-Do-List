To Do List

In this android application a 'To-Do' list was implemented which allows 
the user to enter a title and a description for a task.It allows us to add 
things that we need to do to a list on the screen.

There are two edit text boxes for the user to enter the ' Task Title' and 
'Task Description'. After entering these and pressing the 'ADD' button adds
the task to the 'To-Do' list.

When a user clicks on a particular task from the list for a long time, the
task gets deleted. Each task has a specific check box which on selecting it, 
immediately deletes the task.
